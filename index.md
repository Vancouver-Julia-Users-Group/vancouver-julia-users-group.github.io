# Vancouver Julia Users Group

The Julia users group is an unofficial group in Vancouver, BC for users of the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) of all skill levels. 

The format is:

1. A thirty minute informal presentation on something Julia related.

Volunteers are encouraged! See [here](https://github.com/Vancouver-Julia-Users-Group/vancouver-julia-users-group.github.io) for instructions. This could be a project you're working on, an explanation of a feature of the language, a demonstration of a neat package you found, or something else.

2. An hour+ of project time. 

It's common to hear with Julia that there's interest in learning, but it's hard to find time or your project is heavily invested in another language. This is time we all set aside to work on something Julia language, be it a project or learning the language. Conversations and asking questions is encouraged---this is time with other people who know the language. Bring laptops!
